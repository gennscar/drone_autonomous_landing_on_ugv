This flight is done entirely by hand using both GPS+UWB. I can easily use it as test bench for the filter but the UWB
signal is completely missing or really poor in some segment.

I put 4 anchors on the field and try to fly by hand, sometime some anchors stop working for reasons so the filter
notice that and decided to shutdown after P reached a norm of > 100.
The reason can be the placement of the anchor, the wet ground or the placement of the tag on the drone.

Really strange rosbag, but I learned a think, sometime the first estimation of UWB offset is wrong, so all the others will
be affected by the first. I need to add it to the filter or be sure to obtain a good calibration.

I did a takeoff a 5 meters with UWB + GPS. Start oscillating... yaw estimation?

Here i did 2 takeoff with GPS+UWB, but the x and y dimensions started to diverge, then we take control. I'm sure that the
yaw estimation is to strong and need to be slowed down.
Try here different tatics to tune that part of the filter.

Here i did the takeoff with GPS+UWB, but the x and y dimensions started to diverge, then we take control, I think that the
yaw estimation failed because we didn't let it converge.

Because of the lack of information the filter cannot find the offset of the anchors so it used only the GPS, 
really stable flight but without UWB, only takeoff + a gentle land

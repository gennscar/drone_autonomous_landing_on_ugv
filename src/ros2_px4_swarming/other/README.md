##### **anchorDrone&#46;py**
It is the code running on each drone of the swarm. It initializes the parameteres from *params.yaml* and it is responsible of reacting to the requests for the vehicle. When run, it connects to the Pixhawk and it puts the drone in an idle state, where it waits for external commands. When takeoff is commanded, the vehicle waits for its peers to be ready as well, then reaches a predefined altitude and, when the whole formation is ready, the swarming algorithm is run. If the swarm loses contact with one of its members, it is not considered anymore in the swarming algorithm and a new formation is generated.

##### **numAnchorsNode&#46;py**
It continuously publishes the number of vehicles in the formation.

##### **performanceAnalyzer&#46;py**
It publishes information about the performance of the system (tracking error, inter-anchors distances, synchronization error, ...), so that the architecture could be analyzed through graphs and plots.

##### **plotBag&#46;py**
It plots the data stored in a specific bag file (tracking error, inter-anchors distances, target UWB distances, trajectories, altitudes, tracking velocity, velocities, positions, synchronization error, ...).

##### **targetRover&#46;py**
It is the node through which the followed target is commanded in simulation. Like *anchorDrone&#46;py*, it subscribes to a service to receive the inputs from the user.

##### **trackingVelocityCalculator&#46;py**
It is the brain of the formation: it applies the PID controller to the data received from the anchors and it publishes the resulting tracking velocity, that is equal for every member of the swarm.

##### **unitVectorsCalculator&#46;py**
Not used.

***launch***

##### **launch_drone&#46;launch&#46;py**
Not used.

##### **launch_simulation&#46;launch&#46;py**
It is the script launching all the needed pieces of the simulation. It runs *numAnchorsNode&#46;py*, *targetRover&#46;py*, *anchorDrone&#46;py*, *trackingVelocityCalculator&#46;py*, and *performanceAnalyzer&#46;py*.

##### **launch_test&#46;launch&#46;py**
It is the script launching the central nodes needed to test the system on hardware. It runs *numAnchorsNode&#46;py*, *targetRover&#46;py*, *trackingVelocityCalculator&#46;py* and *performanceAnalyzer&#46;py*.

***models***
---

##### **iris**
The model of the drone used in simulation.

##### **r1_rover**
The model of the rover used in simulation.

##### **uwb_anchor**
The model of the UWB anchor used in simulation.

##### **uwb_sensor**

***other***
---

##### **gazebo_sitl_multiple_run&#46;sh**
It opens gazebo, spawning the desired number and type of vehicles in the chosen world for the simulation.

##### **jinja_gen&#46;py**
It initializes some parameters, included the UWB anchor's identifier.

##### **launchedVehicles&#46;txt**
It stores the number of drones and the information about the presence of the target vehicle. These data are retrieved by the proper scripts to give everybody the needed information for the system to work properly.

##### **launchRTPSAgent&#46;sh**
Not used.

##### **README&#46;md**
This document.

##### **ros2_px4_swarming_aliases&#46;sh**
This file, which should be sourced in the *.bashrc*, generates some aliases, useful to easily launch simulations and tests of this package.

* `dronesethorizontalvelocity 0 1 2`: commands drone 0 to set a velocity of (1, 2), considering a NED reference system
* `dronereturnhome 0`: commands drone 0 to return to its starting point, that is the one where it concluded the takeoff
* `droneland 0`: commands drone 0 to land at its current location

So for example, to launch a simulation with 4 drones and 1 target, the commands should be:
1. `source ~/ros2_px4_ws/src/ros2_px4_swarming/other/ros2_px4_swarming_aliases.sh`
2. `buildws`
3. `gazebosimulation 4 1`
4. `launchsimulation`
5. `swarmtakeoff`
6. `targetroverrandom`
